The Professionals and Clients are both users of the Services provided by CLYPR and are hereinafter referred to collectively as &quot;Users.&quot; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CLYPR solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Grooming Services. CLYPR does not provide or contract for Grooming Services, and Professionals and Clients contract independently for the provision of Grooming Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Grooming Services to be provided and the location at which Grooming Services will be performed, whether on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Grooming Services or by a Professional to provide Grooming Services is a decision made in such person&#39;s sole discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Professionals. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CLYPR does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Grooming Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. CLYPR makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Grooming Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. You understand that CLYPR does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. CLYPR does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Grooming Services on the Services. CLYPR does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CLYPR may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not CLYPR conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client&#39;s needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don&#39;t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In connection with certain services, including Grooming Services, for which reservations are made available on the Services, some Professionals may require you to enter credit card or other payment information, and such Professionals may charge fees for reservations, including cancelled and missed appointments. The Professionals are only allowed to do so in accordance with any policy posted on such Professional&#39;s CLYPR page at the time of your booking. By entering your payment information when requested, you authorize CLYPR and its payment processors to charge and process the fees and charges assessed in connection with your reservations in accordance with the policy described on the Professional&#39;s CLYPR page at the time of your booking. While CLYPR takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, CLYPR is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment information, or your submission of erroneous payment information. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you cancel or don&#39;t show up for an appointment, your credit card may still be charged in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Professional posted on such Professional&#39;s CLYPR page at the time of your booking, at the Professional&#39;s discretion. CLYPR facilitates the payment transaction per these Terms between you and each Professional, but is not responsible for mediating any resulting disputes. CLYPR has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by CLYPR , in each case in CLYPR&rsquo;s sole discretion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional&#39;s availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CLYPR cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CLYPR does not independently confirm that Professionals are licensed to perform the Grooming Services offered by them on our Website. However, when Professionals create accounts with CLYPR, Professionals certify to CLYPR that they are a licensed professional, or if the Professional is a barbershop, merchant or other business entity, all of such Professional&#39;s employees, independent contractors or agents who are providing Grooming Services each are a licensed professional, that they are legally able to provide the Grooming Services they offer to Clients on our Website, and that their business information is correctly represented on CLYPR. CLYPR reserves the right to remove or hide any incorrect, out of date, or illegal information from profiles, as well as remove or hide the entire profile itself at any time. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Accounts </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Account Registration</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By creating an account with CLYPR (an &quot;Account&quot;), you are granted a right to use the Services provided by CLYPR subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms of Service and any other restrictions stipulated to you by us in writing.

You further agree that, in providing such Registration Data, you will not knowingly omit or misrepresent any material facts or information and that you will promptly enter corrected or updated Registration Data via the Services, or otherwise advise us promptly in writing of any changes or updates to your Registration Data.

Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all SNS Content, if any, shall be considered to be Content (as defined below) for all purposes of these Terms of Service. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or CLYPR&rsquo;s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content may no longer be available on and through the Services.
